# php-laravel-react-docker

To start the docker just replace <project_name> by your project name and checkout the docker/.env file to change everything you need.

Add the Laravel or Symfony framework files and the Frontend as well, in this case we are using React, but feel free to modify it to another such Angular or Vue.
